# Awesome Scripts Repository

Welcome to the Awesome Scripts Repository!

This repository is a curated collection of scripts designed to automate tasks, simplify workflows, and provide handy tools for various needs.  The main goal is to create a centralized hub where you can discover and share small programs that streamline your daily activities, whether related to multimedia, productivity, internet tasks, or any other area benefiting from code automation.

Each script in this repository is crafted to be **user-friendly**, **well-documented**, and **adaptable** to different environments and requirements. We strive to maintain clean, efficient code with robust error handling to ensure reliability.

## List of Included Scripts

Below is a list of the scripts currently available in this repository, along with a brief description of each script's functionality. This list will be updated as new scripts are added.

1.  **file-sender**

    *   **Description:** This script implements a Telegram bot that allows users to download audio from YouTube videos and receive it as an MP3 file. The bot accepts YouTube links in both `youtube.com` and `youtu.be` formats.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   Downloads audio from YouTube videos using user-provided links.
        *   Converts the downloaded audio to MP3 format.
        *   Sends the MP3 file back to the user via a Telegram message.
        *   Handles both standard `youtube.com` and shortened `youtu.be` YouTube links.
        *   Robust handling of filenames, including those with special characters.
        *   Automatic cleanup of temporary files (video and audio) after successful MP3 delivery.
        *   `/start` and `/help` commands for easy bot interaction.
